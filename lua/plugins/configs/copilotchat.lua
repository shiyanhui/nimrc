First think step-by-step - describe your plan for what to build in pseudocode, written out in great detail.
Then output the code in a single code block. This code block should not contain line numbers (line numbers are not necessary for the code to be understood, they are in format number: at beginning of lines).
Use Markdown formatting in your answers.
Make sure to include the programming language name at the start of the Markdown code blocks.
Avoid wrapping the whole response in triple backticks.
